## PLAYTEST ROADMAP (Maddy, 2026-06-17) — sequenced

The decline spiral "feels fairly accurate" (Detroit) — KEEP it; the game is decline ↔ **revival**.
Revival = make a pocket worth living in (greens + calm → land value → occupancy → spreads). Build order:

1. ✅ **Bigger generated city / fill the map** — (a) PR #52: ~2× the city (alive ~150→335) by scaling
   the GROWTH eras (era1 founding/site left UNCHANGED — its params drive site scoring, moving them
   clips the grid). (b) PR pending: **satellite exurbs/suburbs** — a new `eraSatellites` (between era4
   and era5) founds up to 4 outlying mini-grids (own arterials + houses), each FREEWAY-linked to the
   core by a BFS connector over open-land/road (paved before the exurb's houses so they can't block
   it). Alive ~335→488; the post-stage road network stays ONE connected component (exurbs are
   genuinely reachable). Could push count/size further; deterministic, N=120 gate intact.
   (c) PR pending: FILL the empty blocks — grid fabric budgets raised to pack the whole grid
   (era2Parcels/satelliteParcels), AND the fill order RANDOMIZED (seeded Fisher-Yates) instead of
   row-major, so any vacancy scatters organically rather than leaving a clean empty bottom band
   (Maddy: "the lower half of these 4x4 grids is always empty... row major is not right, needs
   randomization"). Alive ~488→~1054; the city reads as a real filled place. **Item 1 DONE.**
2. ✅ **Legibility quick-wins** — (a) PR #55: SNES-style plot GLYPHS (R1/R2/R3, C, I, civic letters)
   stamped per parcel (pure `glyphContent`, drawn in the cached base). (b) PR #56: inspect NAMES the
   tile + shows real info (kind name / zone / density / condition% + live pop / land value / health /
   traffic / smog) — `builtKindName` (engine) + `liveInspectLine`. (c) TOOLBAR fixed in item ✅-toolbar
   below. **Item 2 DONE.**
3. ✅ **Revival payoff (deterministic-growth seam)** — PR #61: new fail-closed `src/growth/revival.ts`.
   The LIVE occupancy is sampled into the HASHED stock on the slow civic cadence (never in stepAmbient
   / simTick → N=120 gate untouched): a thriving home heals + densifies (R1→R2→R3), a struggling one
   crumbles to a derelict ruin, REVERSIBLY. Live-verified both directions. The #51 occupancy floor was
   left as-is (revival keys on occ-vs-baseline signal, so the floor doesn't block decay-to-ruin). **DONE.**
4. ✅ **Classic construction tools** — PR #57: the original primitives are always buildable regardless
   of tech (Street/Avenue/Highway/Rail + R/C/I/Civic base zones); the tech tree LAYERS its kinds on top.
   R/C/I plop a density-1 base parcel the revival/growth seam (item 3) then grows.
5. ✅ **Power plants + a real power grid** (PRs #63-66) — SC2000 roster minus microwave (Coal/Gas/Hydro/
   Nuclear classic; Wind/Solar/Fusion up Solarpunk) + distributed EnergyNode. SC1989 conduction (any
   built tile conducts), per-component capacity-vs-demand with brownout (`src/growth/power.ts`, live
   derived field). Hard-gate: unpowered → no growth + slow decay, reversible (composes with revival).
   Dirty plants (Coal/Gas) emit smog → land value → occupancy → decay; renewables clean. Always-on red
   "unpowered" pips + inspect power status. Power OVERLAY (U) added (PR pending). Balance tuning is a
   PLAYTEST-FEEL knob, not an open bug — verified live the grid is non-pathological (city stays alive,
   cars/peds circulate); dial the magnitudes by playing. (Legacy power seeding
   so the start isn't 100% dark is DONE by the redlining arc R1 below.) (Also fixed in #64: multi-tile glyph z-order — drawn in a 2nd pass.)

## REDLINING SYSTEM (arc, 2026-06-17) — produced-by-policy inequity

The worldgen damage now reads as PRODUCED BY POLICY, not nature: a hashed `redline`
grade (discrimination-first social geography + terrain as cover) is the single source
every burden keys off. Vocabulary: live result is "decay"; "redlining/urban renewal"
only critically, Moses-scoped; the player repairs/restores, never "redevelops".
Plan: `~/.claude/plans/love-this-so-far-silly-moonbeam.md`.

- ✅ **R1 — grade + all four worldgen burdens (hashed)** (PR pending) — `GameMap.redline`
  (folded into snapshot, N=120-gated) drawn FIRST in mosesCentury (`worldgen/redline.ts`,
  discrimination-first value noise + low-elevation/near-water cover). All four burdens key
  off it: (a) legacy Coal/Gas plants sited on the most redlined SURVIVING frontage in era3
  (after the highway carve, exempt from era5 abandonment via `isPowerPlant`) — seeds the grid
  so the city is no longer 100% dark (live-verified: 4 plants, 136 powered anchors); (b) era2
  industry sorted grade-first; (c) era5 decay scaled by grade (maxDecay·grade/255), not highway
  distance — near-highway gradient re-emerges as a CONSEQUENCE since (d) era3 highways routed
  through redlined corridors (grade-weighted score). Determinism gate green.
  - ✅ **TUNING accepted (Maddy playtest):** grade-driven decay at `maxDecay 340` + near-zero
    industry reads as RIGHT ("real" — whole redlined neighborhoods to parking). Keep the magnitude.
- ✅ **R2 — legibility (the indictment)** (PR #71) — HOLC overlay (`redlineOverlayContent.ts`, R key
  / dock button) + inspect grade line + opening-briefing `RedlineReport`. Plus PR #72: name redlining
  PRECISELY (housing denial + segregation, cause→consequence), not "disinvestment".
- ✅ **R3 — live service coverage (fire/health)** (PR merged) — FireStation kind provided to greenlined
  zones (withheld from redlined); live `computeCoverage` (ambient); under-served plots lose land value;
  player extends coverage to repair. Inspect served/under-served + a Coverage overlay (V).
- ✅ **R4 — police-oppression civic dynamic** (PR #75) — worldgen `Precinct` concentrated in redlined
  zones (persists through era5); `civicTick` over-policing penalty (voice/trust down, grade-scaled),
  countered by community alternatives. Player defunds (bulldoze → Healing Commons); never builds police.
- ✅ **R5 — infra quality (live):** water (PR #73 — redlined-industry/ground runoff, downstream flow,
  bankside land-value drag, WastewaterWorks heal) + crumbling roads (PR #74 — redlined roads crumble,
  cared-for recover, land-value drag). Both feed the decay loop.
- ✅ **Police live layer** (PR #76) — patrol cruisers from precincts (flashing lights), grade-scaled
  arrests that drain occupancy AND crater household wellbeing, deliberate patrol (hunt citizens / seek
  redlined streets).
- ✅ **Police Violence overlay** (PR #77) — the inverse of a crime map: where the STATE does harm.
- ✅ **Ghost AI** (PR merged) — scatter/chase phases, distinct chase personalities (Blinky/Pinky/Clyde),
  and community safe-zones that REPEL cruisers (the player builds refuge by building community power).

## TOOLBAR + TECH TREE OVERHAUL (overnight 2026-06-17)

- ✅ **Categorized pictorial dock** (PR #58): the flat 20-wide strip → top-level modes (Inspect/
  Bulldoze) + category tiles (Transit/Residential/Commercial/Industrial/Civic/Green/Energy), each a
  pictorial icon, with the picked category's tools in a flyout. Pure `toolMenuContent`; categories
  surface only when they hold a tool, so tech grows the menu.
- ✅ **Relocatable dock** (PR #59): a drag grip moves the dock off the lower map (it blocked the map
  after techs unlocked); clamped to the viewport (`dockLayout`), persisted to localStorage.
- ✅ **Civ-style tech tree** (PR #60): the 7 flat branch columns → a left→right dependency TREE — nodes
  in depth columns (roots left), SVG connector lines per prereq, edges light gold when satisfied.
  Pure `techLayout` (depth + edges); panel is a large 2D-scroll overlay. Click-to-unlock + edge recolor.

## ACTIVE DIRECTION

**Agent-driven simulation.** Mutate from SimCity's 1989 aggregate/cellular-automata layers into an
AGENT-DRIVEN sim with the same kinds of layers (traffic, pollution, land value…), emergent from the
actual travelers. **Determinism: "seeded world, live dynamics"** — worldgen/ecology/civic stay seeded
+ reproducible (N=120 gate over the seeded starting world); dynamic layers live in the live agent
layer (non-deterministic).

- ✅ **Traffic is now agent-driven** (PR pending): the deterministic O-D generator (`generateTraffic`)
  is retired; cars lay a live `state.traffic` field as they drive, the A\* car pathfinder routes
  AROUND congestion, and peds shun it. `map.traffic` stays 0 (out of the dynamic loop; seeded-world
  determinism unaffected).
- ✅ **Pollution is now agent-driven** (PR #48): cars emit a live `state.pollution` field on the tiles
  they drive (heavier on freeways / in congestion, `pollutionEmit`), it lingers as smog and decays
  slowly, peds shun it (`pedCost`), and it renders as a grey haze. Built on the new `ScalarField`
  abstraction (PR #47). Live-verified: smog concentrates on the freeway interchange, clear over calm
  green blocks. Non-hashed — determinism gate intact.
- ✅ **`ScalarField` abstraction** (PR #47): `layField`/`decayField`/`sampleField` — the one shape
  behind wear / water-pollution / traffic / air-pollution, so each layer is a thin lay/decay/read.
- ✅ **Land value is now agent-emergent** (PR #49): a DERIVED live field `state.landValue` recomputed
  on a slow cadence over inhabited plots (`landValueAt`: healed land + amenity proximity, distance-
  weighted, MINUS the worst nearby pollution/traffic/decay). Steers citizen destinations
  (`nearestOfCategory` pulled toward value) and renders as a slate→gold overlay. Live-verified range
  0–96 in the decayed start (slate near arterials/freeway); climbs as the player heals. Non-hashed.
- ✅ **Population is now agent-emergent** (PR #50): a LIVE per-home `state.occupancy`, seeded from the
  census baseline, drifting on a slow cadence toward its building capacity (`capacityOf`) where the
  land is prized/clean/healthy and toward empty where it's decayed/smoggy (`occupancySignal` +
  `occupancyStep`). Total occupancy drives the spawn target (`spawnTargetFor`) and home weighting.
  Live-verified: the decayed car-city net-declines under its own traffic/pollution (465→350 over 25s,
  homes emptying near the worst decay) — metastable, reversible by healing. Non-hashed; the seeded
  building stock is untouched (buildings appearing/disappearing = the deferred deterministic-growth
  seam). **Arc complete: traffic → pollution → land value → population are all agent-emergent.**
  Tuning (OCC_RATE / OCC_LV_NEUTRAL / OCC_OUT_FRACTION) is a PLAYTEST-FEEL knob, not an open bug —
  verified live the loop is metastable (a controlled ~19%/25s decline, the intended decline spiral,
  reversible by healing; NOT the old monotonic spiral-to-zero, which is fixed). Dial by playing.

## Open

- ✅ **Ghost town: population spiralled to empty** (PR pending) — occupancy declined monotonically to
  ~0 (no populated equilibrium). Root cause (diagnosed live): building-HEALTH dominated the occupancy
  signal (≈half the homes negative, ~none positive in the decayed car-city → bad trips → negative
  health → decline → fewer trips that stay bad → spiral), overwhelming the self-correcting land-value
  term. Fix (architectural): land value is the ANCHOR, building-health a minor bounded nudge; add a
  per-home population FLOOR (a city thins but never fully empties); re-anchor OCC_LV_NEUTRAL at the
  live equilibrium so the start is metastable, not free-falling.
- ✅ **Driving-ped substrate exemption is implicit** (PR pending) — extracted `pedDespawns(map, p)`,
  which exempts a driving ped EXPLICITLY by `phase === 'driving'` (no longer relying on a stale
  `walkTo`). Unit-tested: driving ped on a freeway survives; idle one despawns.
- ✅ **Tech tree can't be closed when it covers the menu bar** (Maddy 2026-06-17; PR pending) — added an
  always-visible ✕ in the panel header (the panel top never scrolls, so it's reachable even over the
  dock) + Escape-to-close. Live-verified both.
- ✅ **Biodiversity overlay reads inverted** (Maddy 2026-06-17; PR merged) — was Simpson's index over
  habitat CLASSES (rewarded urban/edge heterogeneity). Redesigned `biodiversityField` to ecological
  RICHNESS (flora × fauna, smoothed): high in thriving wilds, low in the sealed city.
- ✅ **Parking display caps at 4** (Maddy 2026-06-17; PR pending) — the cap was the stall count
  (STALLS_PER_AXIS=2 → 4/tile); bumped to 3 (→ a 3×3 = 9-car grid per tile). The renderer already
  draws every parked car, so a single-tile lot now holds + shows up to 9.
- ✅ **Parking lots only ever held ONE car** (Maddy 2026-06-17; PR merged) — owned cars curb-parked and
  never used lot stalls; now they route to the nearest lot and claim a free stall (parkOwnedCarSomewhere
  → findLotStall), filling to capacity. (Display cap is the separate open bug above.)
- ✅ **Overlay maps need legends** (Maddy 2026-06-17; PR pending) — a visible colour KEY now shows while
  any overlay is up: a swatch per ramp endpoint / HOLC band with its label (top-left). Unified across
  eco/civic/redline/police via `OverlayLegend` + per-module `*Legend()`. Live-verified.

### Pedestrian pathing (Maddy 2026-06-19)

- ✅ **Peds parking + heading north to nowhere from (52,101)** (PR pending) — diagnosed live: the
  greedy `nextStepToward` last-mile router stalls in a LOCAL MINIMUM at a wall — a destination behind
  buildings/a freeway leaves every non-recent neighbour tied on Manhattan distance, so peds dither in
  place (full fuel, not moving) until they burn out and drift home north. Cars already follow a
  committed A\* route (`roadPath`); peds didn't. Fix (one abstraction, mirroring cars): `walkPath` —
  A\* over the WALKABLE set with `pedCost`, ending at the door (≤1 from target); Walk-mode legs follow
  the COMMITTED route via `pathStep` (recompute on destination change via `Mover.pathGoal`, clear at
  leg end / respawn), routing AROUND barriers or giving up cleanly if there's no foot route. Bike/
  transit legs keep the mode-cost step (pedCost doesn't know a tram line). Pure (no rng) — ambient
  determinism + N=120 untouched. Live-verified at (52,101): peds stuck at the freeway wall 21→0; peds
  reaching buildings EAST of the freeway ~0→12; pile-up + northward give-up stream gone.

### Overlay / eco-layer batch (Maddy 2026-06-18)

- ✅ **Power (U) + Coverage (V) overlays wash out** (PR pending) — they tint only sparse BUILDING
  tiles, so translucent green/red vanished against the green terrain (legend/dock toggled, the map
  didn't). Fix = ONE abstraction: `OverlaySource.dimBase` — the renderer scrims (OVERLAY_DIM, near-
  black 0.66) every un-highlighted tile, and the highlights paint at a strong 0.92 alpha, so the
  powered/dark + served/under-served plots GLOW against a darkened city. Live-verified: pressing U/V
  now dims the map and the buildings pop green/red. (Redline/eco/civic fill the map already → no dim.)
- ✅ **Eco overlay should include water + ground + air pollution** (Maddy 2026-06-18) — the E cycle
  is now soil→flora→fauna→biodiversity→air→ground→water.
  - ✅ **Air + water** (PR #92) — `airPollution` (live `ambient.pollution`, traffic smog, over land)
    + `waterPollution` (live `ambient.waterPollution`, runoff, over water — the dingy creeks). Also
    fixed the stale "Simpson index" biodiversity legend copy → "richness".
  - ✅ **Ground pollution = a NEW live land-contamination field** (PR pending) — `accumulateGround
    Pollution`: industry + dirty power + demand-path litter/wear poison the ground they sit on and
    the land around them (grade-scaled, seeps a tile), lingering (GROUND_DECAY 0.8) but reparable —
    it clears once the source is gone. The land analogue of water runoff (the source the creeks run
    off from). Live-verified: 1214 contaminated tiles, max 254, litter feeding in from 1271 worn
    tiles; the `groundPollution` eco view (clean land → toxic ground). Non-hashed; N=120 gate intact.

### Agent-movement substrate cluster (Maddy 2026-06-18) — likely ONE missing abstraction

The live agents are violating substrate constraints. Probable single fix: an authoritative
"valid surface per agent" predicate (peds: walkable land/roads, NEVER water or freeway; cars: park
only on non-freeway surfaces).

- ✅ **Pedestrians cross water** (PR pending) — peds were being PLACED on water (degenerate spawn/
  retire), not stepping there (nextStepToward already rejects water). Fix: a self-heal guard in the
  ped loop snaps any walker off a non-walkable tile via `nearestWalkable`, or respawns it home.
- ✅ **Pedestrians cross freeways** (PR pending) — same root: peds inheriting a freeway-parked car's
  tile. Cleared by the parking fix below + the self-heal snap. Live-verified 0.
- ✅ **Cars park on freeways** (PR pending) — THREE sources, all now funnel through one predicate
  `isParkable` (carTraversable && not freeway && not over-water): (a) `parkOwnedCarSomewhere`
  fallback dumped the car on its current (freeway) tile when no kerb was free → now it leaves;
  (b) `retireOwnedCar` left a lost owner's car lingering mid-freeway → now it drives off;
  (c) `nearestDriveStart` spawned an owned car parked on a freeway beside its home → now non-freeway
  only. Live-verified: 19 → 0, holds at steady state (~90s, 82 cars parking normally).
- ✅ **Big parking-lot blocks hold one car per lot** (PR pending) — lot selection keyed off the lot
  CENTRE within PARK_RADIUS, so a big lot (centre far from its edges) was never picked from where
  cars arrive, and stalls filled row-major from a far corner. Fix: select by clamped-BBOX distance
  and take the free stall NEAREST the arrival, so blocks fill tile-by-tile from the destination side.
  Live-verified: curb-parks 29->3, a 234-stall lot 0->15 cars, lots now hold up to 31 (was ~1).
### Divided-road / lane redesign (Maddy 2026-06-18, spec'd) — needs edge-aware passability

Both are in `freewayLane` / `carPassable` / `nextRoadStep` (oscillation-prone — TDD carefully). The two
road types want OPPOSITE crossing rules, which is the missing abstraction: limited-access freeways vs
at-grade avenues. Diagnosed but DEFERRED — a focused redesign, not a patch.

- ✅ **Freeway lanes + limited access + ramps** (PR pending) — DONE (Maddy's spec): a 3-wide freeway
  is south→east, north→west, **middle a two-way `through` lane** (the dead `median` role reserved for
  the future road-diet planted median); freeways are **LIMITED-ACCESS** via an edge-aware
  `canDrive(from→to)` (enter/move only along the freeway; cross/turn only at ramps/interchanges/ends),
  rewired into `roadPath` + `nextRoadStep`. Connectivity is kept by **worldgen ramps**: a `RoadRamp`
  kind (a drivable freeway-AND-street tile) dropped as cross-sections through each corridor every
  `era3RampSpacing` (8) tiles where the grid flanks it — an on/off + at-grade crossing (Maddy: ramps =
  a street overlaid on a freeway). Live A/B (default seed, 150s): without ramps it doubled the decline
  (−48% vs main −26%); **with ramps it's −22% — connectivity fully restored**. 1226 tests green.
  - ✅ **Planted no-traffic median** (PR pending) — `BuiltKind.PlantedMedian` (11): a road-DIET
    upgrade (gated by the `road-diets` capability) converting a 3-wide highway's interior `through`
    lane into a planted, no-traffic green median. Removes a traffic lane (calmer corridor) + a green
    amenity (lifts land value); cars never drive on/across it (green barrier). `freewayLane` counts the
    median in the road's width band so the flanking carriageways stay one-way; engine-pure
    `isInteriorRoadLane` gates `convert-11` to interior lanes only; reversible. Live-verified: medians
    inert (0 traffic), carriageways still flow (92 cars), renders as a green center strip.
  (Ramps generalize to overpasses — ✅ DONE via the `map.deck` elevation layer; see the overpass entry
  under the freeway-bridge item below.)
- ✅ **Avenues block cross traffic at intersections (the "streetcar" bug)** (PR pending) — the blocker
  was the tram tile: a `Streetcar` (transit) tile isn't `carTraversable`, so the A* router couldn't
  take a cross street through it. Fix: a LEVEL-CROSSING rule in `canDrive` — a car may CROSS an
  at-grade tram/rail line (`isLevelCrossable`: Streetcar/Rail) straight through to the drivable tile
  beyond, but never drive ALONG it; `carOffNetwork` no longer despawns a car mid-crossing. Unit-tested
  (cross a tram, can't drive along it, the avenue/streetcar/avenue median crosses). At-grade avenues
  themselves already allow committed cross-routes (canDrive returns true for non-freeway tiles).

### Freeway/build follow-ups (Maddy 2026-06-18)

- ✅ **Avenues had the same lane-math problem as freeways** (PR pending) — committed routes (A*/
  `roadPath`) used `canDrive`, which returned true for at-grade avenues regardless of direction, so
  cars drove the WRONG WAY on the one-way avenue lanes (free-driving already respected one-way via
  freewayStep; committed routes didn't). Fix: `canDrive` enforces a divided avenue's outer-lane
  one-way (can't enter against `dir`), but UNLIKE a freeway keeps it crossable (a cross street may
  cross perpendicular to a road beyond). Unit-tested + live-verified: 0 wrong-way avenue cars,
  occupancy decline normal (−24%/120s, no stranding).
- ✅ **Ramp in the middle of the freeway cross** (PR pending) — `placeCorridorRamps`' `sideRoad` check
  accepted ANY `isRoadKind` (incl. the perpendicular freeway) as a "flanking road," so a ramp landed
  at the freeway×freeway interchange. Fix: a ramp must connect to a SURFACE road (street/avenue) —
  `surfaceRoad` excludes highway/ramp — so no ramp drops at the interchange (already a free crossing).
  Unit-tested (ramp at a grid-flanked column; interchange stays highway) + live-verified.
- ✅ **Cannot build a nuclear plant anywhere** (PR pending) — `canPlaceParcel` clamped footprints to
  `MAX_FOOTPRINT = 3`, but Nuclear (and Fusion) plants are 4×4, so every placement was rejected.
  Bumped MAX_FOOTPRINT to 4 (the largest plant). Unit-tested: a 4×4 footprint places on clear land.
- ✅ **More early-game civic services concentrated in greenlined areas** (PR pending; Maddy feat) —
  added Clinic/Library/School BuiltKinds (33/34/35) — civic SERVICE stations like the fire station.
  era3 concentrates them on greenlined frontage (withheld from redlined; `era3CivicServices`=3 each),
  they extend the live service-coverage field (coverage overlay retitled "Civic services"), render
  (CL/LB/SK glyphs + distinct styles), and are player-buildable (repair the redlined zones). Live-
  verified: 3 of each placed at mean grade 66 (greenlined); unit-tested (greener than precincts).
- ✅ **Prevailing wind carries smog** (PR pending) — air pollution now DRIFTS one tile downwind along
  a seeded per-world prevailing wind (`prevailingWind`: 8-dir integer unit vector from the ambient
  rng, never the sim streams) each WIND_CADENCE pass via `driftPollution` (conservative transfer;
  off-map smog leaves the system), so plumes streak from their sources instead of diffusing in place.
  Live layer, non-hashed; no transcendental Math (stays on the pure-ui allowlist). Live-verified: a
  steady source yields a clean downwind plume (250→189 over 6 tiles), zero upwind leakage; wind
  varies by seed.
- ✅ **Block-by-block organic growth** (PR pending) — new `eraOrganicGrowth` (the newest layer, after
  era5): settlement ACCRETES outward from the ENDS of transport lines (freeway ends, bridge landings,
  arterial tips) into the open land beyond — `terminusOutward` finds termini facing open land + pointing
  away from the core, each seeds a small organic cluster (stub + rungs + houses via fillFrontage),
  spaced + capped. Composes with the satellite/bridge masses; stays one connected network; deterministic,
  N=120-gated. The BlightReport tracks it as its own term (`organicAdded`) and excludes it from the
  historical core/periphery disinvestment gradient (the report measures the inherited wound, not new
  growth). Live-verified: 8 clusters / +305 parcels on the default seed. NOTE: this is the accretion-
  from-termini half; "central districts densify/expand outward" is already served by the live
  occupancy/revival densification loop. Tunables: organicSeeds/organicReach/organicBlocks/organicParcels.
- ✅ **Freeway skipped a tile for water (gap at 85,86)** (PR pending) — the era3 highway carve called
  `placeTransport`, which refuses water, so a corridor crossing an inlet left a gap in the deck. Added
  a `placeBridge` engine primitive (decks transport OVER water, keeping the water layer underneath — a
  bridge, not a causeway; never decks a building); `carveCorridor` uses it. Live-verified: (85,86)/
  (86,86) now RoadHighway-over-water, the freeway continuous. Non-golden N=120 gate intact (bridging
  only adds highway tiles).
  - ✅ **Overpasses (the per-tile elevation model)** (PR pending) — a second HASHED `map.deck` layer
    holds ELEVATED transit (ElevatedRail/Promenade) over the road below — the generalization of
    `placeBridge` (a transport deck over another). Cars/peds pass UNDER unaffected (grade-separated).
    `canPlaceOverpass`/`placeOverpass`/`removeOverpassAt`/`overpassAt`/`deckMask`; building an elevated
    kind OVER a road decks an overpass (over land it's at-grade); bulldoze removes the deck first.
    An elevated promenade deck is ped substrate — a promenade overpass carries peds ACROSS a freeway
    they can't cross at grade (live-verified: contiguous substrate across, bare freeway not walkable;
    renders lifted w/ a drop shadow). Worldgen leaves the deck 0, so N=120 stays byte-identical.
    🔮 FOLLOW-ONS (need playtest judgment): elevated-rail train sim on the deck; car-under-deck z-order;
    worldgen-placed overpasses; an explicit ramp/incline model.
- ✅ **Worldgen bridges expand the city to other land masses** (PR pending; Maddy feat) — eraSatellites
  now, after the land exurbs, detects the biggest OTHER land masses (`otherMassEntries`) and, for each
  within reach (`satelliteMaxBridge`=30, `satelliteBridgeCount`=2, `satelliteMinMassSize`=250), decks
  a freeway BRIDGE to its nearest-road bridgehead (`layBridgeToRoad`: gradient descent on the
  distance-to-road field, `placeBridge` per step) and founds an exurb there. Live-verified on the
  default seed: 1 bridged exurb across open water on a 743-tile mass; road network stays one connected
  component; N=120 gate intact.

## Fixed

- ✅ **Owned cars: no freeway 2× speed / didn't prefer freeways** (PR pending) — cars now follow a
  committed A\* `roadPath` whose `driveTileCost` makes freeways cheap, and the `driving` handler runs
  2× on `RoadHighway`.
- ✅ **Owned cars parked on freeways** (PR pending) — they park at a free non-freeway spot
  (`findParkingNear`/`findCurbSpot` exclude `RoadHighway`).
- ✅ **Owned cars stacked in street parking** (PR pending) — `findCurbSpot` excludes occupied tiles,
  so a car parks at a free spot down the block instead of on top of another.
- ✅ **Owned cars drove in circles** (PR pending) — they follow a COMMITTED least-cost path, which
  cannot circle (replaced greedy step-by-step routing).
- ✅ **No cyclists** (PR pending) — a medium leg cycles again; bike-friendly infra now just lowers the
  routing cost rather than gating the mode.
- ✅ **Cars vanish at plots / when the rider gets out** (PR #44) — citizens own persistent cars that
  park and are walked to; sim-car visualization retired.

> **Root-cause theme (resolved):** PR #41–44 hardened the sim-car path; the v2 owned-car driving was
> a separate greedy reimplementation. Fix was architectural — make car-agents follow committed
> least-cost paths + park in real free spots (one abstraction, not per-symptom patches).
