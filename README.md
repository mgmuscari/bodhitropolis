# Bodhitropolis

A dharmapunk browser city-builder — a deterministic, procedurally-generated
world atop the GPL-3 Micropolis lineage (the open-sourced SimCity Classic by
Will Wright / Maxis). This repository hosts the modern TypeScript engine in
the root `src/` / `tests/`; the original Micropolis ports live in their legacy
subtrees (`micropolis-activity/`, `MicropolisCore/`, `micropolis-java/`) and
are reference-only.

## Quickstart

```bash
npm install        # install the toolchain (Vite + TypeScript + Vitest)
npm run dev        # serve the app at http://localhost:5173
npx vitest run     # run the test suite
npm run build      # production build (tsc typecheck + vite bundle)
npm run typecheck  # type check only (tsc --noEmit)
```

Open `http://localhost:5173/?seed=<anything>` to generate a specific world.
The same seed always produces the same world — reload to confirm.

## Architecture

Code is split into three layers with a strict, test-enforced purity rule
(`tests/architecture.test.ts`):

- **`src/engine/`** — the deterministic simulation core: a seeded PRNG
  (`rng.ts`, sfc32 with `fork`-by-label streams), a fixed-tick loop
  (`loop.ts`), the layered typed-array tile map (`map.ts`), and the
  built-environment model (`fabric.ts`: the `BuiltKind` taxonomy, the
  `ParcelStore`, placement functions, and connectivity queries). Imports
  nothing from `worldgen` or `ui`.
- **`src/worldgen/`** — value noise / fBm (`noise.ts`), the staged generation
  pipeline (`pipeline.ts`), the terrain stage (`terrain.ts`: elevation,
  ocean/lake/river, moisture, biomes), reusable spatial-field helpers
  (`fields.ts`: distance fields, box density, land runs), and the
  `moses-century` history stage (`moses.ts`). May import `engine`.
- **`src/ui/`** — a Canvas2D pixel-art renderer (terrain plus an autotiled
  road/rail and footprint-aware building overlay), pan/zoom camera, and input.
  Only this layer and `src/main.ts` touch the DOM.

**Determinism is load-bearing.** `engine` and `worldgen` use only integer math
and exactly-rounded float ops (`+ - * / sqrt`, `Math.imul/floor`) — no
transcendental `Math` (`exp`/`pow`/`log`/`sin`/`cos`/`tan`) and no
`Math.random`, because their results vary across JS engines and would break
"same seed → same world" between browsers. The seeded `rng` is the only
randomness source. This is what makes shared-seed worlds (and the planned
historical simulation) reproducible.

### Built environment (fabric)

The map carries two tile layers for the built world — `built` (a `BuiltKind`:
roads, rail, or a Moses-era building) and `parcel` (the id of the owning
building footprint). Building *attributes* that don't fit in a tile — kind,
density, and condition — live in a parallel-array `ParcelStore` on the
`WorldState`. Because attributes sit outside the map, `hashWorld(world)` (map
snapshot + parcel bytes), not `map.snapshot()` alone, is the canonical
determinism hash for stage tests.

The placement functions in `fabric.ts` (`placeParcel`, `placeTransport`) and
their inverses (`demolishParcel`, `demolishTransportAt`) are the **single
writers** of those layers — everything else queries. Transport placement merges
same-category junctions (road-on-road, rail-on-rail) to the higher-capacity
kind so two roads can share a crossing tile; road↔rail crossings are rejected.
Demolition tombstones parcels (`ParcelStore` keeps an `alive` flag rather than
compacting, because the `parcel` tile layer holds baked ids); `transportMask`
drives renderer autotiling and `parcelTouchesRoad` answers frontage queries.

### The Moses-century history stage

`moses-century` (`moses.ts`) is the settlement stage: it grows a coherent city
on the terrain and then wrecks it, in five deterministic era sub-steps that
each fork their own rng stream and thread one shared `MosesState`:

1. **Founding & streetcar town** — picks a flat, water-near, rail-extendable
   site; lays a street grid; runs streetcar rail as radial extensions beyond
   the grid; grows an early fabric of houses, commerce, and a civic core.
2. **Motor age** — upgrades the arterials to avenues, extends the grid, and
   adds rail/water-frontage industry and downtown parking.
3. **Highways & urban renewal** — carves a highway corridor (and often a
   perpendicular second) through the densest fabric, demolishing what stands
   in its path, rips out every streetcar rail, and drops tower-in-the-park
   Projects and a civic megablock.
4. **Suburban flight** — grows street spurs into open land away from the
   expressways and fills a suburban ring (measured by *road-network* distance,
   not crow-flies), while the inner-city core declines.
5. **Disinvestment** — decays every parcel by a redlining-shaped falloff of
   highway distance and abandons (demolishes) those that fall below threshold,
   leaving parking craters — the blighted start state.

Each era writes a line into `world.log` (the chronicle), so the generated
history is legible. Like every stage it is **deterministic** (same seed → same
city) and touches only the `built`/`parcel` layers and parcel attributes — the
four terrain layers are byte-identical before and after.

### The opening challenge

When the app loads, an overlay turns the generated history into the game's
first move: it names the city, tells its century, shows its wounds, and asks
the player to heal it. The pipeline is pure and headless-tested; only the final
overlay touches the DOM.

- **City name** (`engine/names.ts`) — `cityName(rng)` builds a pronounceable,
  title-cased name from a `'city-name'` fork of the world seed (so the name is
  reproducible and independent of the worldgen streams).
- **Chronicle** (`worldgen/chronicle.ts`) — `parseChronicle(world.log)` groups
  the era log lines into entries with fixed year ranges (1900–2000), skipping
  the bare stage names and preserving event text verbatim.
- **Blight report** (`worldgen/report.ts`) — `buildReport(world)` reads the
  final state: parcels standing, condition mean/median and derelict/struggling
  shares, projects still standing, and — sourced from the era-5 chronicle line,
  so the numbers match the prose beside them — the abandoned/cratered counts.
  The core-vs-periphery gradient is reported as a survivorship-free abandonment
  share (the highway core loses far more than the far suburbs).
- **Copy** (`ui/openingContent.ts`, pure) — `statLines`, `eraHeadline`, and
  `challengeText` turn the report and chronicle into legible strings; the
  overlay shell (`ui/opening.ts`) mounts them.

Dismiss the overlay with **Begin**, **Enter**, or **Escape**; the map is live
beneath it. Append **`?nointro=1`** to skip the overlay entirely. Because every
input is the deterministic world, `?seed=<anything>` reproduces an identical
name, chronicle, and numbers on every load.

## Methodology

This project is built with the Dialectic development methodology. See
